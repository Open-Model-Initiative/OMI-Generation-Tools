When creating HDR data:

1. **Licensing**: Only use assets that you have proper rights to use, such as:
   - CC0 licensed content
   - Assets you own/created
   - Assets explicitly allowing AI/dataset usage

2. **Quality Control**:
   - Ensure proper HDR settings are enabled
   - Verify the output files maintain HDR data
   - Check image quality and exposure
   - Include preview images where possible

3. **File Formats**:
   - Save in EXR format for HDR data
   - Include PNG previews when supported
   - Use consistent naming conventions

4. **Documentation**:
   - Note the tools/version used
   - Document any special settings
   - Include setup requirements
